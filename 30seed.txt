Another interesting and memorable number between 1 and 100 in Dark Souls is 30. The number 30 is significant in Dark Souls for several reasons:

    It's the soft cap for many important stats in the game, including Vitality, Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity

. Reaching 30 in these stats provides substantial benefits, after which further increases yield diminishing returns.
30 is also a key number for covenant rankings. For example, offering 30 Sunlight Medals to the Warrior of Sunlight covenant allows players to obtain the highest rank and unlock the powerful miracle Great Lightning Spear
.
In PvP and co-op play, level 30 is often considered a sweet spot for early-game invasions and jolly cooperation, especially in areas like the Undead Parish or Blighttown
.
The number 30 is also relevant to weapon upgrades. Many weapons reach their maximum potential at +15 normal upgrade or +5 special upgrade, which requires a total of 30 upgrade steps

    .

This number is different from 4 (the number of major lords) but still holds significant meaning within the game's mechanics, making it an interesting choice for your tests.
